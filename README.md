Charcot disease, also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons, the nerve cells responsible for transmitting signals that control muscle movement. It progressively leads to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually, an inability to perform voluntary movements.

Since the eye motor muscles are the last to remain functional, many eye-tracking solutions have been developed to provide patients with maximum autonomy. However, these solutions are often expensive and require grant applications that take a long time to process—time that patients often do not have due to the extremely rapid progression of the disease.

We, four graduate students, work on the project to develop a low-cost, open-source eye tracker for home automation, enabling individuals to equip themselves independently at minimal cost.
